movement:
    the player stands still
    the world moves around it
    the player only falls along the vertical axis due to gravity
rail grinding:
    triggers on both sides of the pole to detect the rails
    when not grounded both triggers have to detect a rail (perhaps a few invincibility frames due to physics unreliableness)
